back-end:
  * detect and prevent duplicate remotes, at least for GUI
  * ensure that closing a remote will kill the connecting process
  * fix memory leaks in perl process
  * EV not playing nice with Net:OpenSSH (not detecting child exits)
  * refactor Vmprobe::Remote to handle multiple connections

web ui:
  * should be able to drag from any part of title-bar (ie red "probe" span)
  * if connection is lost to web-server should grey out screen and show error
  * column sorting
  * way to save and reload settings
  * time-series plotting

cmd line:
  * output should always be in deterministic order (usually by specified remote order)
    * sortable
  * example use-cases in --help output



memory info:
  * show active versus non-active memory


fs cache:
  * implement locking/snapshots



new windows:
  * saved snapshots
  * cpu info
  * process viewer "like top(1)"
    * allows throttling, renice, cpu affinity
  * netstat
