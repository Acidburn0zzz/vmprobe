  * if connection is lost to web-server should grey out screen and show error
  * column sorting
  * way to save and reload settings
  * time-series plotting

cmd line:
  * output should always be in deterministic order (usually by specified remote order)
    * sortable
  * example use-cases in --help output
  * fix vmprobe cache diff



memory info:
  * show active versus non-active memory


fs cache:
  * implement locking
